### Source Code

```
Ok, MacShell on PSC was pretty cool (there is my review, now on to my idea)
I have looked and looked for good Mac OS X shells, and I have found a few. But none of them have my favorite feature, the bottom bar that has the icons that move when you mouse over.
 My idea is this:
 Since DirectX Dock has been submitted, we now have all the components nessasary to make a complete OSX Shell! I want to get a few programmers together to develop this, as I think it could really be cool! E-mail me if you are interested shawnjcox@hotmail.com thanks!
